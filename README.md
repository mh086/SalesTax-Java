# SalesTax-Java
Sales Tax:  Write a class SalesTax that will calculate the sales tax on a purchase.  
(This should be similar to the BankAccount class on pages 96 and 97). 
a. There should be a constructor that accepts as input the state sales tax rate and the county 
sales tax rate.  These will be two different inputs (2 parameters).  (6 points)
b. Write a method that calculates the sales tax.  This method should accept as input the price 
of the purchase (this will be used later so it needs to be assigned to a variable belonging to 
the class â€“ an instance variable) and calculate the total sales tax charged on the purchase. (7 
points)  
c. There should be another method that calculates the total cost by adding the initial purchase 
(variable you received in previous method) and the sales tax.  (7 points)
d. There should be a method to return sales tax. (5 points)
e. There should be a method to return the total cost. (5 points)

Write a tester class that asks the user to input the purchase price.  The tester class should use a 
state sales tax rate of 6 percent and a local sales tax rate of 4 percent.  (These are input to the 
SalesTax class).  
Create an object using the sales taxes given. (4 points) 
Execute the method to calculate the total sales tax using the input.  (4 points)
Execute a method to calculate the total product cost.  (4 points)
Print the original price, the total sales tax, and the total cost of the product. (4 points)
